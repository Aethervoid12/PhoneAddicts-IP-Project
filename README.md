# PhoneAddict's NPEats

This is an app designed to encourage students to eat and spend money in NP as opposed to eating outside by offering random discounts as a reward for eating in NP. By randomising the discounts, it also encourages students to try foods from other locations within NP itself.

## Design Process

The design process for this was how to exactly entice students to stay within NP to eat. Most students nowadays are extremely apathetic towards everything and are extremely extrinsicly driven, thus we decided on a material reward (discount codes) to entice them. We thought of the following user story:

As a student, I want to be able to get cheap food, so that I can save money for things I want to buy.

So, we decided to make a system where spending money in NP would earn you credits, and you'd be able to use said credits to randomly redeem discounts to NP locations. This perpetuates a cycle where because they get discounts, they will be more motivated to eat in NP, and in turn earn more discounts.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and Javascript was used to make this. The 3D models were made with Maya, Adobe Substance Painter and Marmoset, and uploaded to Artstation. XD was used to design the wireframes, and Visual Studio Code was the app used to test the code. Microsoft Teams and Jira were used to help coordinate the work.


## Credits

Login Page code was adapted from https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-your-first-login-page-with-html-css-and-javascript-602dd71144f1

Lots of other code from w3schools.com was used as guides to coding.

## Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from the spin the wheel websites where the rewards would be randomized
